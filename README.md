## About the Video Course
Video Description
Python is a powerful high-level, object-oriented programming language. This is a comprehensive guide on how to get started in Python and how you could learn it with the help of games.

In the first section, we will be building our first game. We will use pure Python programming in combination with the built-in Python Turtle module. We will learn how to move our runner around a game screen which we’ll create. In section two, we will enhance what we have learned in section one by combining the power of Turtle Graphics with the tkinter framework. We will add scoring to our game, create obstacles and increase the speed of the game.

In section three, we will install and use the PyGame module. PyGame is used to build professional games but we can start quite simple. We will be building a game with a player that runs and jumps within landscapes. We will learn how to use PyGame sprites and sprite sheets to animate our game. In the fourth section, we will use the PyGame module to build a three-dimensional game. We will build a starship and learn how to navigate it in space. We will explore several features of PyGame to avoid collisions with asteroids and destroy them.

By the end of this video course, you'll gain a solid understanding of Python along with a hands-on experience in building amazing games. So let’s Rock & Roll!
